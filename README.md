## Database Schema

The system uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with the following main tables:

- `leads` - Facebook leads and conversion tracking
- `products` - Product catalog and inventory
- `orders` - Order management and tracking

- `purchase_invoices` - Supplier invoices for product purchases
- `expenses` - All business expenses by category
- `returns` - Return order management
- `return_items` - Items within return orders

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account
- Git

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ascend-global
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings > API to get your project URL and anon key
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 5. Set Up the Database

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `database-schema.sql` and execute it
3. This will create all necessary tables, indexes, triggers, and sample data

### 6. Configure Row Level Security (RLS)

The database schema includes RLS policies. You may need to adjust these based on your authentication requirements:

- For development: The current policies allow all authenticated users to access all data
- For production: Consider implementing user-specific policies

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
